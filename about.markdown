In August 2023, I joined the [Cambridge Triathlon Club](https://www.cambridgetriathlonclub.com/), and I started a learning journey about endurance sports training and sports physiology.

When I started, I could not swim for more than 2 pool lengths without running out of breath, I used only normal city bikes for commuting, and I was a very slow runner (5h 48m Marathon, albeit a hilly trail one).

In little over one year, I completed a swim marathon (10 km), I completed my first half Ironman Triathlon, I improved my Marathon time down to 4h 1m, and I completed my first 100 Km run.

In the process, I learnt a lot, and I also noticed that a lot of the training information I could find was targeted at the average athlete trying to improve, rather than a total beginner.

In particular, I get often asked by colleagues and friends about how to get started in some of these sports. Hence, in this blog I'll try to focus on information that would have helped me as a total newbie.
